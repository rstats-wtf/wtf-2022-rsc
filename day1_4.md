  * General Git resources I consult the most
    - [Git for Humans](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans) is
      a great set of slides by [Alice Bartlett](https://alicebartlett.co.uk),
      originally delivered in 2016 at UX Brighton.
    - [Git in Practice](https://www.manning.com/books/git-in-practice) by Mike
      McQuaid is a very approachable and practical book, probably better than
      Pro Git for most people starting out. Ancillary materials
      [on GitHub](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/GitInPractice).
    * The book [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) is fantastic and
      comprehensive. I consult the online version as a reference.
