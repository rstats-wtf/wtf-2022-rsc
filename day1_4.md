Activity prompts

  * *instructor-led activities*
  * if time permits, work on porting packages-report project into a GitHub-synced repo
    - Keep working in the project we initiated on GitHub, then cloned, and practiced in.
    - Go through several cycles of: bring R script over, commit & push, execute script, see the output appear, commit and push, etc.
    - Play with rendering to `.md` if you like.
    - We'll work up to finishing it with a README.
  * The project you downloaded earlier today, via `use_course("rstd.io/wtf-packages-report")`, provides everything you need to finish this off, i.e. `shhh-secret-for-later-README.Rmd` is a nice start for a README.
  * The finished product I showed you is here: <https://github.com/rstats-wtf/wtf-packages-report-EXAMPLE>
  * A version from Jim Hester that include a proper Makefile <https://github.com/jimhester/my-packages/tree/jims>
