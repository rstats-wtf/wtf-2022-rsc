Agenda

  * Intro to GitHub and Git, with RStudio
  * Using R Markdown and R with Git, GitHub, and RStudio (if time permits)
  
Slides

  * [git-and-github-early-usage.pdf](materials/git-and-github-early-usage.pdf)
  
Activity prompts

*Instructor will lead the group through the first 2-3 activities. The remaining prompts are here in case we finish early (ha!) or if those activities are a bit too basic and you'd rather accumulate more practice by porting your morning's work in Git/GitHub.*

  * [Set up (or verify) a PAT for HTTPS](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html)
  * [New project, GitHub first](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html)
  * [Test drive R Markdown](https://happygitwithr.com/rmd-test-drive.html)
  * [Render an R script](https://happygitwithr.com/r-test-drive.html)

  * Port your `packages-report` project into a GitHub-synced repo
    - Keep working in the project we initiated on GitHub, then cloned, and
      practiced in.
      Or start with your existing local project and push it up to GitHub using
      either the [Existing project, GitHub first](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first.html)
      or [Existing project, GitHub last](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html) workflow.
    - Go through several cycles of: bring R script over, commit & push, execute
      script, see the outputs appear, commit and push, etc.
    - Play with rendering to `.md` if you like.
    - Finish it off with a good README.
  * The project you downloaded earlier today, via
    `use_course("rstd.io/wtf-packages-report")`, provides everything you need to
    finish this off, i.e. `shhh-secret-for-later-README.Rmd` is a nice start
    for a README. *TODO: verify/update for 2022*
  * The finished product I showed you is here:
    <https://github.com/rstats-wtf/wtf-packages-report-EXAMPLE>
    *TODO: verify/update for 2022*
  * A version from Jim Hester that include a proper Makefile
    <https://github.com/jimhester/my-packages/tree/jims>
    *TODO: verify/update for 2022*
  
Resources

  * Git/GitHub motivator and explainer: "Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?"
    - PeerJ preprint: <https://dx.doi.org/10.7287%2Fpeerj.preprints.3159v2>
    - In The American Statistician: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928>
  * [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html)
  * General Git resources I consult the most
    - [Git for Humans](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans) is
      a great set of slides by [Alice Bartlett](https://alicebartlett.co.uk),
      originally delivered in 2016 at UX Brighton.
    - [Git in Practice](https://www.manning.com/books/git-in-practice) by Mike
      McQuaid is a very approachable and practical book, probably better than
      Pro Git for most people starting out. Ancillary materials
      [on GitHub](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/GitInPractice).
    * The book [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) is fantastic and
      comprehensive. I consult the online version as a reference.
