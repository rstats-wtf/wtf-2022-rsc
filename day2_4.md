## Day 2, Session 4

### Iterating well with purrr, with Shannon Pileggi

### Learning objectives

* Briefly discuss iterative techniques that do not require loops or `purrr::map_` (for example, group_by, vectorized functions, etc.

* Explore lists as an object to store information of varying types and sizes; explain how to extract elements from a list.

* Apply functions from the `purrr::map_` family to perform iteration as an alternative to loops.
